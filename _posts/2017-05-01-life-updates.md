# Life can come at you fast
Just wanted to give a quick update as to what has been a relatively silent last few months. Early March, I and several of my fellow employees were let go. Over the last couple months, I was looking for new challenges.

I've since regained employment and partially moved to North Carolina. In that time frame, I've also stepped down as a moderator at sharepoint.stackexchange.com. I am planning on writing more now that I'm back in the swing of things, however the focus will be shifting back to on prem SharePoint mostly.

Thank you all for your understanding.
