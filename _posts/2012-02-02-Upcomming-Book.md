<div>I generally don't like to toot my own horn but sometimes it's a necessity.&nbsp; I'm pleased to announce that the book I wrote a chapter in is going to press.&nbsp; I was contacted by Mark Miller of <a href="/web/20130419214243/https://www.nothingbutsharepoint.com/">nothingbutsharepoint.com</a> (<a href="/web/20130419214243/http://twitter.com/EUSP">@EUSP</a>) to submit a chapter for a book.&nbsp; Honored to be asked to do this, I agreed happily.&nbsp; The title of the book is <strong><em>SharePoint at Work – Tricks, Traps, and Bold Opinions: The Best of EndUserSharePoint.com</em></strong> and can be preordered on <a href="/web/20130419214243/http://www.amazon.com/SharePoint-2010-Work-Tricks-Opinions/dp/1449321003/">Amazon.com</a> for 45% off.<br><br>I wrote Chapter 9, an updated version of one of my most highly commented posts on nothingbutsharepoint, <a href="/web/20130419214243/https://www.nothingbutsharepoint.com/sites/eusp/Pages/qotd-sharepoint-document-library.aspx">QOTD: SharePoint Document Library</a>.&nbsp; This has been updated and revised for 2010 in the book.&nbsp; <br>
