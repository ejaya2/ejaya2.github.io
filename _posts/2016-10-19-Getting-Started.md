I think I'm in a position where I can start jotting down some of the daily frustrations working with SharePoint Online and Office 365. I have a few articles in mind and will start putting them out once I get the blog up and running. I am trying GitHub Pages - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
