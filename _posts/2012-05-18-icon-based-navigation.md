The other day a fellow SharePoint friend, [Tasha Scott](http://twitter.com/TashasEv), [tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/TashasEv/status/202845586062450688) with a problem. Sometimes Twitter is great and sometimes not so much. In this case it was the later as there wasn't really enough to give a good response because of the character limit.

It wasn't until she posted on [sharepoint.stackexchange.com](http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/36507/icon-based-menu-that-dynamically-changes-based-on-permissions) that I was able to fully understand what she was wanting to do.&nbsp; I'll give you a moment to view that post.

Fortunately for her, I've done this type of thing, albeit without the security trimming, but that's easy to overcome. You only need a custom list, a document library (if one doesn't exist), SharePoint Designer, and a bit of creativity to pull this off. If SharePoint Designer is prohibited in your environment, you can pull this off in a similar fashion using jQuery and [SPServices](http://spservices.codeplex.com)

In the coming posts, I'll detail how to create a icon driven user interface.
