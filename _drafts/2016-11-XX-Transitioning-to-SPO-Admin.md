Welcome back friends. Today in this catchy title, I wanted to go over some of the things that might trip you up as you transition to SharePoint Online. This caters specifically to SharePoint Online, if you are running hybrid, then you still need to remember all your on premises information.

## It's a Service, and it is not ours

In most organizations, the IT department is a service center, offering tools and services for the organization to operate. These are systems like line of business systems (SAP) to financial systems and HR systems. This can also mean collaboration systems like SharePoint. We would manage the infrastructure and have administrators and developers in place to make sure the system is operating optimally and provide value add functionality for the business users.

In the SharePoint Online space, the infrastructure and farm are abstracted away from us and is managed by Microsoft. It is their responsibility to make sure the health of the service is running optimally.
